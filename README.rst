What is PEPA
============

PEPA is a document, in a PEP format, presented in PyConES 2015, in a talk about priviledges and diversity.

Translations
============

Due to the interest that the PEPA caused, we wanted to have this document translated to as much languages as possible. We use the Transifex tool to keep the versions translated and synchronized.

Currently, these languages are available:
